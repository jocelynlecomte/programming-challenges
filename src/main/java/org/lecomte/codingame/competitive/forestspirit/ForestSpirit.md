## Changes

### 1.0 Wooden League 2

The possible actions are COMPLETE and WAIT, we only have big trees There is just 1 day, and we have a lot of sun points.

- Find the action in the given possible actions leading to the best score and apply it

### 2.0 Wooden League 1

We can now GROW trees, and we have only small trees at the beginning. There are 6 days, and we have few sun points at
the beginning.

- If there is a COMPLETE action, do it
- Else GROW the biggest tree
- Else WAIT

### 3.0 Bronze League

Added shadows and SEED actions. We only have two small trees at the beginning.

Try to get as much sun points as possible by growing trees and seed new trees. The more trees we have the more the
actions cost... Don't worry with shadows for now. COMPLETE trees only when we have enough big trees.

- If we have reached the big tree limit, COMPLETE the best tree
- If we can GROW a seed, do it because the seed is useless by itself
- If we don't have any seed, SEED because it's free
- Get the GROW actions, sort them by size and richness and GROW until we have reached the big tree limit
